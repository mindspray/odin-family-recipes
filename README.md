####A website for recipes (from a Brazilian-German family)  
This will be a recipe website featuring recipes from the perspective of a  ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·Brazilian-GermanğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª family living in the UnitedğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸States. I hope this can serve as a reference for myself, my family, as well as anyone else interested in the cuisine.
